# speech-to-text-ai-assistant
This project is a real-time speech-to-text assistant built using AssemblyAI and OpenAI. It captures live audio input through a microphone, sends it to AssemblyAI's WebSocket API for transcription, and uses OpenAI to generate intelligent responses based on the transcription.
